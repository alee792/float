# Float
 

## A POC of a Twitter managment suite, written in node. (WIP!)
Float brings the concept of root users to your social media platforms. All communications from shared accounts can no be reviewed by a super user before they hit the web and cause a PR disaster! 

This is more of a mockup with basic CRUD, some features do not exist. The user stats are "fake," there's no settings page, etc. 

## Setup
* Navigate to project directory and `npm install`, start up mongo, and `npm start`
OR 
* `docker-compose up -d`. The image should be on DockerHub, but if not, build with `docker build -t alee792/float`
